## matters needing attention
In this project, gorm.model structure has been modified, and the ID field has added tag: json: "id", so that the keys of the front-end and back-end JSON can correspond one by one
~~~go
type Model struct {
	ID        uint `gorm:"primary_key" json:"id"`
	CreatedAt time.Time
	UpdatedAt time.Time
	DeletedAt *time.Time `sql:"index"`
}
